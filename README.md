# Hexagonal This

I was greatly influenced when I saw the video in YouTube about Alistair's hexagonal architecture. Big shout out to **Alistair Cockburn** for beautifully explaining the com.poetry.console.port and adapter's pattern (a.k.a hexagonal architecture). I loved it just because of its separation of concerns which enables high scalability and helping me introduce the plug and play concept. I wanted to try out the same KATA as **Thomas PIERRAIN** (again impressed with TDD and being bullet proof) while watching the video but with Java. 


## KATA - 1

- Write the left side com.poetry.console.port for test for requesting poetry i.e. **`RequestVerse`**.
- Write the domain i.e. **`PoetryReader`** which can be hardcoded. This very first version of the business logic returns an hard-coded result.

## KATA - 2

- Write the right side com.poetry.console.port **`ObtainPoem`** with adapters i.e. test which fetches the poem using stubs.

## KATA - 3

- Write a **`ConsoleAdapter`**(left side) which could write to the console (default) as the default publication strategy.

## KATA - 4

- Write a **`Console`** application for the end user.

## KATA - 5

- Write a **`PoemFileAdapter`** (right side adapter) that will return the content by reading the file.
